Hi, I’m Nipa, a Software Engineer. As of September 2022, I have been Machine
Learning Engineer Intern in Selangor (Malaysia) for four months, exploring and
evaluating global face detection & recognition solutions for e-KYC documents.

Catch me outside of work; you’ll find me reading books, blogs, newsletters,
gaming, or watching content for my study on YouTube channels.
