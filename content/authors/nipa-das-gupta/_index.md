Hi, I'm Nipa, a Software Engineer. As of September 2022, I have been Machine Learning Engineer Intern in Selangor (Malaysia) for four months, exploring and evaluating global face detection & recognition solutions for e-KYC documents.

Catch me outside of work, you’ll find me reading books, blogs, and newsletters, gaming, or watching the content for my study related on YouTube channels.
