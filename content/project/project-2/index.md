This project is a (share price) data visualization and analysis problem that aims to build functionality to be added to JPMorgan Chase traders' dashboard to allow them to input specific information so they can monitor a new trading strategy. To develop the dashboard required to set up the system using JPMorgan Chase frameworks and tools and interface with the relevant financial data feed, make the required calculations and then present this in a way that allows the traders to visualize and analyze this data in real-time.

The following task was carried out in this project:

+ Interface with a stock price data feed and set up the system for analysis of the data

+ Implement the Perspective open source code in preparation for data visualization

+ Use Perspective to create the chart for the traderâ€™s dashboard
